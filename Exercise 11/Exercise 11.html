            <h2>Rockstar Games are one of my favorite video games to play since I was a kid. 
                These games in my opinion, has the greatest story-line, immersive gameplay, 
                gameplay interaction, and open world exploring. 
                One of my favorites among the rockstar Grand Theft Auto Franchise is GTA San Andreas.
                The story follows former gangster Carl "CJ" Johnson, who returns home following his mother's murder and
                is drawn back into his former gang and a life of crime while clashing with corrupt 
                authorities and powerful criminals. Carl's journey takes him across the fictional U.S. 
                state of San Andreas, which is heavily based on California and Nevada and encompasses 
                three major cities: Los Santos (inspired by Los Angeles), San Fierro (San Francisco) 
                and Las Venturas (Las Vegas).

            <h2>Coca-Cola, or Coke, is a carbonated soft drink manufactured by the Coca-Cola Company. 
                Originally marketed as a temperance drink and intended as a patent medicine, 
                it was invented in the late 19th century by John Stith Pemberton in Atlanta, Georgia. 
                In 1888 Pemberton sold Coca-Cola's ownership rights to Asa Griggs Candler, a businessman, 
                whose marketing tactics led Coca-Cola to its dominance of the global soft-drink market throughout the 20th and 21st century. 
                The drink's name refers to two of its original ingredients: coca leaves, and kola nuts (a source of caffeine).

                Chocolate is a food product made from roasted and ground cacao pods, that is available as a liquid, solid or paste, on its own or as a flavoring agent in other foods. Cacao has been consumed in some form since at least the Olmec civilization (19th-11th century BCE),[1][2] and the majority of Mesoamerican people - including the Maya and Aztecs - made chocolate beverages.[3]
