            Southern California of USA, the single-player story mode has three main protagonists: Michael De Santa
            (A Retired Bank Robber),Franklin Clinton (A street gangster), and Trevor Phillips (A drug dealer and gunrunner).

            The open world design allows players to explore the outskirts of San Andreas such as the open country roads and experience the 
            details of the fictional city of Los Santos. The game is played through first-person and third-person perspective allowing it's 
            players to experience diffrent player angles. Throughout single-player, players control the three main heroes and can switch between 
            them both within and outside of missions. The robbery sequences are essential to the plot, and many missions require shooting and driving.
            A "wanted" system governs the aggression of law enforcement response to players who commit crimes.The game's online multiplayer option, Grand Theft Auto Online, 
            allows up to 30 people to compete in a variety of cooperative and competitive game scenarios.
            </p>
            <p style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%; text-align:justify;">
            To combat enemies, players use melee attacks, firearms, and explosives, and may run, jump, swim, or use vehicles to navigate the world. 
            To accommodate the map's size, the game introduces vehicle types not seen in its predecessor Grand Theft Auto IV, such as fixed-wing aircraft.
            In combat, auto-aim and a cover system may be used as assistance against enemies.If players commit crimes, law enforcement agencies may respond as indicated by a "wanted" meter in the head-up display (HUD).
            Stars displayed on the meter indicate the current wanted level (for example, at the maximum five-star level, police helicopters and SWAT teams swarm to lethally dispatch players). When players are concealed 
            from the officers'line of sight that appears on the mini-map for a length of time, the meter enters a cool-down mode and ultimately fades away.

            Players control Michael De Santa, Trevor Philips, and Franklin Clinton, three criminals whose tales intertwine as they perform objectives in the single-player mode. 
            During missions, the game may automatically switch characters to fulfill particular goals. The compass avatar of a character will flash red if he is in danger and needs assistance, 
            and white if he has a strategic advantage.While players can complete missions as any of the three protagonists, the more difficult heist missions require the assistance of AI-controlled 
            accomplices with specialized skills such as computer hacking and driving. If an accomplice survives a successful heist, they receive a portion of the cash reward and may be available for 
            later missions with improvements to their unique skills. Some heists allow for multiple strategies; for example, in a holdup mission, players can either use an incapacitating agent to 
            subdue civilians quietly or storm the venue with guns drawn .Outside of missions, players may swap between characters at any time using the directional compass on the HUD, however this ability is restricted at certain times throughout the tale.
            </p>
            <p style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%; text-align:justify;">
            Each character has an array of eight talents that show their proficiency in various areas such as shooting and driving. Though skills grow with practice, 
            each character has a default talent (e.g., Trevor's flying skill).The eighth "special" skill influences the efficiency of a character's ability that is unique to them. In combat, 
            Michael enters bullet time, Franklin slows time while driving, and Trevor deals double the damage to enemies while taking half the damage in combat. A meter on each character's HUD 
            depletes when an ability is used and regenerates when players perform skilled actions (for example, drifting in vehicles as Franklin or performing headshots as Michael) .<br>
            <br>
            Players can engage in context-specific activities such as scuba diving and BASE jumping while free-roaming the game environment. Each character gets a smartphone that may be used to contact friends, 
            initiate activities, and access an in-game Internet.[26] The Internet allows players to exchange stocks on a stock market. Players can also buy assets such as garages and companies, as well as 
            improve their weapons and cars. Players can also go to locations like movie theaters and strip joints. Outfits, hairstyles, and tattoos are available for purchase, allowing players to personalize their image .

        <font face="Sans-serif" color="White"</font>
            <p style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%; text-align:justify;">The game's development started around the same time as Grand Theft Auto IV and was spread across several of Rockstar's studios across the world. 
                To improve on the main framework of its predecessors, the production team took inspiration from several of their prior games, 
                including Red Dead Redemption and Max Payne 3, and developed the game around three primary protagonists.
                The open environment was created in large part through development effort, and many team members went on field research across California to record video for the design team. 
                The game's music is an original composition by a group of producers that worked together for several years. 
                It was published for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 in September 2013, the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One in November 2014, and Microsoft Windows in April 2015. In March 2022, the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S versions will be released.<br>
                <br>
                More than 1,000 people worked on the game, including Rockstar North's core team and staff from parent company Rockstar Games' studios all over the world.
                The game's proprietary Rockstar Advanced Game Engine (RAGE) was overhauled for the game to improve its draw distance rendering capabilities.
                The Euphoria and Bullet software handle additional animation and rendering tasks.According to analyst estimates, the game's total development and marketing budget 
                was around GBÂ£170 million (US$265 million), making it the most costly game ever developed at the time.<br>
                <br>
                The open world was based on Southern California and Los Angeles, and its design and in-game rendering took up a large portion of the game's early development.
                Key members of the game world production team went on field research trips throughout the region, documenting their findings with photos and video footage.
                Google Maps projections of Los Angeles were used by the team to help design Los Santos' road networks .<br>

                <p style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%; text-align:justify;">The idea of giving players control of three lead protagonists instead of one was first proposed during the development of Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas, 
                but hardware limitations made it impossible. After developing two Grand Theft Auto IV episodic expansion packs featuring new protagonists in 2009, 
                the team wanted to base Grand Theft Auto V around three simultaneously.The team saw it as a spiritual successor to many of their previous games 
                (including Grand Theft Auto IV, Red Dead Redemption, and Max Payne 3), and designed it to improve on their gameplay mechanics. 
                They aimed to improve the action gameplay by refining the shooting mechanics and cover system, and reworked the driving mechanics to fix Grand Theft Auto IV's awkward vehicle controls.<br>
                <br>
                The game was first announced by Rockstar Games on October 25, 2011. A week later, they released its first trailer,
                along with an official press release acknowledging its setting. Journalists noted that the announcement sparked widespread anticipation within the gaming industry, which they attributed to the series' cultural significance.
                The game was pushed back to September 17, 2013, to allow for more polishing.<br>
                <br>
                At E3 2014, the game was re-released for Microsoft Windows (PC), PlayStation 4, and Xbox One. 
                This enhanced version includes a new on-foot first-person view option, 
                which required the development team to overhaul the animation system to accommodate first-person gameplay. 
                The PlayStation 4 and Xbox One versions were released on November 18, 2014. The PC version, 
                which was originally scheduled for simultaneous release with the con, was released on November 18, 2014.
                According to Rockstar, it required additional development time for "polish."
                The PC version is capable of 60 frames per second gameplay at 4K resolution, and the Rockstar Editor lets players capture and edit gameplay videos. 
                Plans to develop single-player downloadable content were later scrapped as the team focused resources on Grand Theft Auto Online and Red Dead Redemption 2.
                A trailer for the new version released in September 2021 was met with criticism, becoming one of the most-disliked videos on PlayStation's YouTube channel; 
                journalists noted that fans were frustrated by Rockstar's continued focus on the game rather than other projects such as a new Grand Theft Auto game, 
                as well as the lack of obvious new features demonstrated in the trailer.

                The online multiplayer mode Grand Theft Auto Online was created in tandem with the single-player mode as a separate experience to be played in a constantly evolving world.
                Up to 30 players[n] freely roam across the game world and enter lobbies to complete jobs (story-driven competitive and cooperative modes).
                The Content Creator toolset allows players to create their own parameters for custom jobs, such as racetracks and deathmatch weapon spawn points.
                Crews are organized groups of players that work together to fulfill tasks. Rockstar Games Social Club connects Max Payne 3 multiplayer crews to Grand Theft Auto Online crews. 
                Players may form their own squads and join up to five others. Crews win multiplayer battles in order to get experience points and move up the online leaderboards.<br>
                <br>
                Grand Theft Auto Online was released on 1 October 2013, two weeks after Grand Theft Auto V.
                Many players reported connection difficulties and game freezes during load screens.
                Rockstar released a technical patch on 5 October in an attempt to resolve the issues,
                but problems persisted the second week following launch, with some players reporting their character progress as having disappeared.
                Many reviewers criticized their Grand Theft Auto Online experience due to significant technical difficulties at launch, 
                although they largely recognized its open-ended exploration and dynamic material as benefits.Some players reported being banned from 
                Grand Theft Auto Online for using field of view and cosmetic mods in single-player shortly after the game's PC release.
                Rockstar stated in their official blog that no one had been banned from Online for using single-player mods, but that recent 
                updates to the PC version had the "unintentional effect" of making such mods unplayable. They mentioned that changes are not authorized and may cause unanticipated technical issues and instability.
