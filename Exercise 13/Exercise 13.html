                        The open world design allows players to explore the outskirts of San Andreas such as the open country roads and experience the 
                        details of the fictional city of Los Santos. The game is played through first-person and third-person perspective allowing it's 
                        players to experience diffrent player angles. Throughout single-player, players control the three main heroes and can switch between 
                        them both within and outside of missions. The robbery sequences are essential to the plot, and many missions require shooting and driving.
                        A "wanted" system governs the aggression of law enforcement response to players who commit crimes.The game's online multiplayer option, 
                        Grand Theft Auto Online, allows up to 30 people to compete in a variety of cooperative and competitive game scenarios.

                        To combat enemies, players use melee attacks, firearms, and explosives, and may run, jump, swim, or use vehicles to navigate the world. 
                        To accommodate the map's size, the game introduces vehicle types not seen in its predecessor Grand Theft Auto IV, such as fixed-wing aircraft.
                        In combat, auto-aim and a cover system may be used as assistance against enemies.If players commit crimes, law enforcement agencies may respond 
                        as indicated by a "wanted" meter in the head-up display (HUD).Stars displayed on the meter indicate the current wanted level (for example, 
                        at the maximum five-star level, police helicopters and SWAT teams swarm to lethally dispatch players). When players are concealed 
                        from the officers'line of sight that appears on the mini-map for a length of time, the meter enters a cool-down mode and ultimately fades away.
